Microservices architectures with REST APIs, C#, ASP.NET Core, MongoDB, RabbitMQ and Docker

## The author
Welcome to my Project! I'm Carlos. 

## Project
Here for some of the things I did in this project:

- ASP.NET Core 5 based microservices from scratch using Visual Studio Code
- MongoDB NoSQL databases for exclusive use by each microservice
- Implement asynchronous inter-service communication via RabbitMQ and MassTransit
- Microservices architecture fundamentals
- Common design patterns used with microservices like repository, retries with exponential backoff and circuit breaker
- C# 9 record types to define DTOs and message contracts used by the microservices
- Common operations of a microservices REST API
- Docker and Docker Compose to run services like MongoDB and RabbitMQ in your box to support your microservices
- Swagger/OpenAPI and Postman to explore and interact with your microservice APIs
- A resilient inter-service communication via IHttpClientFactory and Polly
- Eventual data consistency by replicating data across microservices
- Integrated microservices with a real world React based single page application
- NuGet packages to share reusable logic and message contracts across microservices
- Two microservices of an end to end application where players can purchase game items with virtual currency
